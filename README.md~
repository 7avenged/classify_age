# classify_age
Extreme data preprocessing and model development for text classification using scikit learn, NLTK etc..



RESULTS- 

4 ALGOS TRIED WHICH ALSO OFFERED CONFIDENCE INTERVAL-

RANDOM FOREST
LOGISTIC REGRESSION
LINEAR SVC
BERNOULLI NB
MULTINOMIAL NB

OUT OF THESE, RANDOM FOREST AND SVC TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO EXECUTE AS COMPARED TO BERNOULLI NB AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN ACCURACY, SO BERNOULLI NB WAS CHOSEN.

ACCURACY OF LOGISTIC REGERSSION WAS LOW, SO IT WAS DISCARDED.

ACCURACY- PLEASE FIND THE SCREENSHOT ATTACHED


APPROACH FOR USING MULTIPLE FEATURES-

CLEANED THE DATA EXHAUSTIVELY.(TOOK THE MOST TIME)
JOINED THE FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME XOLUMN(WITH SPACE IN BETWEEN)
DID VECTORIZATION OF FEATURES.
APPLIED THE ALGORITHMS ON THEM.
COMPARED THE RESULTS.

AVERAGE EXECUTION TIME:- 68 SECs.

Thank you.
